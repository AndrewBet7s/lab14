We are going to put together the pieces of building a game - collision detection, boundary detection and then putting it all together with animation.

# 70pt - Collision Detection
### Make the target rectangle turn red when you enter it with the player.

# 85pt - Boundary detection
### Use the dimensions of our Canvas to limit the players movement to what we can see (don't let them get off screen!)

# 100pt - Putting it together
### Animate the target moving left to right, and make a game where you have to catch the target. Add in movement buttons for left, right and down, and make the target stop when you hit it!
